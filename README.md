# Sazgir

A minimal bootstrapped linux userland (work-in-progress), using [Cosmo](https://justine.lol/cosmopolitan/)
libc and [unveil/pledge](http://justine.lol/pledge/) for security hardening.

## Purpose
Sazgir is intended to be a `hackable` linux userland, with the goal being that the system is
small enough that the person running it can tinker with it or add/remove pieces.
